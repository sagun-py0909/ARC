**Option 1: The Science of Sweat**
🧪 **Upgrade Your Biology.**
The gym builds muscle, but recovery builds resilience. Introducing the Aura Duo Hybrid Sauna — the only recovery tool that combines the deep cellular penetration of Far Infrared with the intense heat shock of a traditional stove (up to 90°C).
Built from toxin-free Canadian Hemlock, this isn't just a sauna; it's a metabolic optimization chamber. Trigger heat shock proteins, detoxify at a cellular level, and reset your circadian rhythm.
Your recovery protocol just got an upgrade.

**Option 2: The Ultimate Hybrid**
🔥 **Why Choose One When You Can Have Both?**
Most IR saunas stop at 60°C. The Aura Duo doesn't settle. By fusing Far Infrared technology with a traditional stove, we deliver the "Hybrid Heat" experience — reaching a scorching 90°C for true athletic recovery.
Step inside the premium Canadian Hemlock cabin, sync your Bluetooth audio, and let the chromotherapy lighting guide your mind while the heat optimizes your body.
Perfect for pairing with your IceCode plunger. Contrast therapy starts here.
